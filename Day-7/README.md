Identifiers:

    Identifiers are names given to variables, functions, types, constants, and other entities in a program.

    Rules:

            Must start with a letter (Unicode character) or an underscore _.
            Can contain letters, digits, and underscores.
            Case-sensitive.
            Cannot be a Go keyword.

        Example: myVariable, myFunction, MyType, MY_CONSTANT, etc.


Keywords:

    Keywords are reserved words with predefined meanings in the Go programming language. They cannot be used as identifiers.

        Examples: func, var, const, if, else, for, switch, case, select, package, import, type, struct, interface, etc.

Operators:

    Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values.

    Types:

        Arithmetic operators: Used for mathematical operations (e.g., +, -, *, /, %).
        Comparison operators: Compare values (e.g., ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=).
        Logical operators: Combine conditions (e.g., &&, ||, !).
        Assignment operators: Assign values to variables (e.g., =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, etc.).
        Bitwise operators: Perform operations on individual bits of values (e.g., &, |, ^, <<, >>).
        Unary operators: Act on a single operand (e.g., +, -, ++, --).

        Example: + (addition), - (subtraction), == (equality check), && (logical AND), = (assignment), << (bitwise left shift), etc


For Loop:
     The for loop is used for repetitive tasks. 
     It can have different forms: for loop, for-range loop, or for loop as a while loop
     Go does not have a while loop construct explicitly, but you can use the for loop as a while loop.
